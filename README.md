# ```minishell```

This program is an attempt to replicate the ```bash``` shell in a ```C``` program.

## How to use it
To try out ```minishell```, compile it first using:
```bash
make re
```
Then, open the shell as follows:
```bash
./minishell
```

It works exactly like ```bash```, so feel free to navigate using ```cd```, create folders with ```mkdir```, or change the environment with ```export <your variable>=<the value of your variable>```.
